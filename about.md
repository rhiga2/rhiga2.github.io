My name is Ryley Higa. I am currently a master's student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying artificial intelligence and machine learning for audio signal processing under Professor Paris Smaragdis. I am originally from Honolulu, Hawaii, where I lived for about 18 years. That being said, don't ask me if I know how to surf; I barely know how to swim.
