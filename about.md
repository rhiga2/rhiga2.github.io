I am a machine learning engineer for Sumo Logic based in Honolulu, HI. I primarily work on creating AI tooling for logs and metric analysis that can help devops and secops engineers troubleshoot and monitor their applications. I also created a monthly educational meetup called Deep Learning Hawaii that teach locals how to create and best use AI for business, safety, and productivity.
