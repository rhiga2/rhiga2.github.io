One of my new year's resolutions for 2018 is to learn about deep reinforcement learning. To be honest, this was my new year's resolution last year, but if I learned anything from graduate school it's that convincing myself I'm too busy is often quite easy. Graduate school never fails to remind people like me that sometimes being busy and being productive are mutually exclusive phenomenon. This year is different though--as any resolutioner would say--so lets actually learn deep reinforcement learning together with Berkeley's deep reinforcement learning course: CS 294-112.

I am a firm believer that the best method to learn is by doing. Lectures, while usually helpful, are often not as interesting and interactive as assignments and homeworks. (This is what I say to myself after taking a long nap in some of my machine learning theory lectures.) For this reason, I will only briefly discuss lectures, but not in excruciating detail since the courses videos and slides are posted publicly [here][cs294-page]. The content of this blog will be inspired and not copied from the materials of CS294 since (1) I don't have permission to disseminate material from Professor Sergey Levine and the course staff and (2) I don't think reading a blog that copies freely available material on the web is particularly exciting. So why even read this blog? CS294-112 is a dense and highly mathematical course aimed at graduate students. The goal of this blog is to democratize the growing body of deep RL research for practitioners and people without too much experience in math so that everyone can be up to date on the latest trends and limitations that are currently shaping the field of artificial intelligence. With that said let's jump in!
