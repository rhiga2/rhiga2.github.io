One of my new year's resolutions for 2018 is to learn about deep reinforcement learning. To be honest, this was my new year's resolution last year, but if I learned anything from graduate school it's that convincing myself I'm busy is often quite easy. Graduate school never fails to remind people like me that sometimes being busy and being productive are mutually exclusive phenomenon. This year is different though--as any resolutioners would say--so lets actually learn deep reinforcement learning together with Berkeley's deep reinforcement learning course: CS 294.

I am a firm believer that the best method to learn is by doing. Lectures, while usually helpful, are often not as interesting and interactive as assignments and homeworks. (This is what I say to myself after taking a long nap in some of my machine learning theory lectures.) For this reason, I will only briefly discuss lectures, but not in excruciating detail since the courses videos and slides are posted publicly [here][cs294-page]. The content of this blog will be inspired and not copied from the materials of CS294 since (1) I don't have permission to disseminate material from Professor Sergey Levine and the course staff and (2) I don't think reading a blog that copies freely available material is particularly exciting. So why even read this blog? Remember that this blog is more about deep reinforcement learning than CS 294. In addition, I like to transform complicated and sometimes inaccessible mathematical concepts into plain English, and so if you want simplified explanations to an otherwise challenging and interesting course and research frontier look no further. With that said, let's jump in!
