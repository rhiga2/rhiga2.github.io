# The Beginning
In November 2022, I created a monthly AI meetup group based in Honolulu, HI called AI Hawaii. Before moving back to Hawaii in 2022, I lived in the Bay Area where paper reading groups, research talks, and data professional panels were so ubiquitous that it was impossible to not feel left behind by the lightspeed development of AI. Upon moving back to Honolulu, I struggled to find an active AI and deep learning community. And so I built one.

It just so happened that AI became an ultra-mainstream topic after the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI on November 30th, 2022. AI was always a mainstream topic among developers and tech enthusiasts after AlexNet smashed records on a 2012 visual recognition contest known as ImageNet. What separated the hype of AI before and after ChatGPT was the people that started to buzz about AI. Coverages on the frontiers, ethicality, and business practices of AI were not only confined to tech magazines, research conferences, and AI professionals. You could now find these discussions among the opeds column in daily newspapers, gossip on social media, and non-tech workers such as realtors, bank managers, restaurant owners, and writers. Talks of AI were everywhere.

# Our Vision
With the increased interest in AI from mainstream media, my audience and mission for AI Hawaii has shifted as I see AI changing so much more than just the tech industry. What was previously a meetup dedicated to mostly developers and data professionals became tailored towards the people that will be affected by AI, which make no mistake is everyone! Our vision has therefore evolved to satisfy both tech and non-tech audiences with some our meetups being developer workshops and the other being non-technical discussions on the ethical and business implications of deep learning. 

Over time, I hope that the education I provide through AI Hawaii will help locals adapt to changes that AI will inevitably bring into our lives. Hawaii's economy has always been dependent on tourism, government, and food services and is often said to lack diversity in areas such as tech. This lack of job diversity makes Hawaii weaker to major economic disruptions such as a global pandemic that halts tourism or even widespread job displacement due to AI automation. One of my core principles is that education and AI literacy is the solution to make Hawaii more robust to AI distruption, and AI Hawaii is the vehicle to give back education to the island and community that has given so much to me.
