## What is a Reinforcement Learning Task?
In reinforcement learning tasks, there are two basic components: an agent and its environment. As an example, suppose we want to create a self-driving car that can drive itself from Silicon Valley to our own private island of Arallon. The agent in this case is our self-driving car, and the environment is the physical world through which our car has to navigate. At each moment the agent reads some observation from the environment in the form of street view videos, google map data, and LIDAR sensors and must decide on what actions to take based on previous and current observations. Our agent decides actions using what's called a policy  \\( sin(x^2) \\).
