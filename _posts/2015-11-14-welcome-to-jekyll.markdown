# The Beginning
In November 2022, I created an AI meetup group based in Honolulu, HI called Deep Learning Hawaii. Before moving back to Hawaii in 2022, I lived in Redwood City, CA where paper reading groups, research talks, and data professional panels are so ubiquitous that it was impossible to not feel left behind by the lightning development of AI research, tools, and best practices. Honolulu was a different story. I struggled to find an active AI and deep learning community. And so I built one.

It just so happened that AI became an ultra-mainstream topic after the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI on November 30th, 2023. AI was always a mainstream topic among developers and tech enthusiasts after AlexNet smashed records on a visual recognition contest known as ImageNet in 2012 and possibly before then. What separated the hype of AI before and after ChatGPT was the people that started to buzz about AI. Coverages on the frontiers, ethicality, and business practices of AI were not only confined to tech magazines, research conferences, and data professionals. You could now find these discussions among the opeds column in daily newspapers, gossip on social media, and non-tech workers such as realtors. AI is the buzzword.

# Our Vision
With the increased interest in AI in mainstream media, my audience and mission for Deep Learning Hawaii has shifted as I see AI changing so much more than just the tech landscape. What was previously a meetup dedicated to mostly developers and data professionals became tailored towards the people that will be affected by the AI wave, which make no mistake is everyone. Our vision has therefore evolved to satisfy both tech and non-tech audiences with half our meetups being developer workshops and the other half being non-technical discussions on the ethical and business implications of deep learning. 

Over time, I hope that the education I provide through Deep Learning Hawaii will help the people of Hawaii adapt to changes that AI will inevitably bring into our lives. Hawaii's economy has always been dependent on tourism, government, and food services and is often said to lack diversity especially in tech. This lack of industrial diversity in Hawaii becomes problematic when major economic disruptions come about such as a global pandemic or widespread job displacement due to automation. I strongly believe that the best way to combat the negative impact of AI disruption is through AI education.
